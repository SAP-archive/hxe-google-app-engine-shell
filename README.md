# SAP Developers, Sample 1
Sample application for GAE and HXE. This following example is a skeleton or shell for use in creating a Node.js based application for deploymenet on the Google App Engine with a connectivity to an [SAP HANA express edition server](https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/sap-public/sap-hana-express?project=hana-express-cloud) running within the Google Cloud Platform, Compute Engine.

This shell is provided "as-is". For more information on working with SAP technologies please vist the [SAP Developer Center](http://developers.sap.com) at [developers.sap.com](http://developers.sap.com).

GAE is the Google App Engine, [https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/) 

> Build modern web and mobile applications on an open cloud platform: bring your own language runtimes, frameworks, and third party libraries. Google App Engine is a fully managed platform that completely abstracts away infrastructure so you focus only on code. Go from zero to planet-scale and see why some of todayâ€™s most successful companies power their applications on App Engine.

HXE is the SAP HANA, express edition [https://www.sap.com/developer/topics/sap-hana-express.html](https://www.sap.com/developer/topics/sap-hana-express.html)

> SAP HANA, express edition is a streamlined version of SAP HANA that can run on laptops and other resource-constrained hosts.
